# Information:
  Just thinking. It is base on https://github.com/pfrazee/ctzn and youtuber https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkcL4my2wgDRFvjQOJzrlg 

  Trying to understand the designa and logic of coding.

# Design:
  Current build for server and p2p in developement.

  To build the web server to access from any browser device.

  To create module script required some code. Which is not easy as it could leak memory.

# Users:
  User will have some sandbox and island like data format to self contain to prevent spamming.

## Security and Authentication and Network:
  Since there will be network, peer to peer, and server talking to other server base on the researching and development to have some permission system. As well some default settings for each servers and peer to peer. Each owner is responsble for maintain.

  One is mature content and spam is not build for it.

  To have super user since one is the server owning and maintain hosting is montior file size and connection. As well clean up if the file size is increase or to off load to other servers.
